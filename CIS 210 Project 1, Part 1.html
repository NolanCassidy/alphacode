  <h1>Project 1, Part 1</h1>
<p>This assignment is due Friday, September 30 at 5pm. Save your Python program
  in a file called alphacode.py and turn that file in using Canvas.</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>Practice sequential programming.  Understand numeric
  representation and modular arithmetic. 
</p>
</div>


<div class="item">
<h1>Too many PINs</h1>

  <p>We have to remember too many numbers:  credit card PINs, student
  ID number, codes to open doors, and on and on.  We're warned that we
  should remember these numbers instead of writing them down, but
  really the human brain is not well-suited to remembering a lot of
  meaningless numbers.  I'll admit: I write them down.  But could I
  remember more?</p>
  <p>People aren't any better at remembering random sequences of
  letters than remembering random sequences of digits.  However, we
  are much better at remembering sounds we can pronounce. The word 
 “fesi” doesn't mean anything to me, but it's easier to
  remember than the number 2354 or the harder-to-pronounce word
  “iksf”. It turns out to be pretty easy to convert
  numbers like 2354 into pronounceable nonsense words like
  “fesi”</p> 

  <p>To create words that are easy to pronounce, we can build them out
  of consonant-vowel pairs like “ka” or “te”.
  As it turns out, if we omit ‘x’ and treat
  ‘y’ as a consonant, the English alphabet has 20
  consonants (bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwyz) and 5 vowels (aeiou). 20×5=10×10=100,  so one consonant and a
  vowel (20×5 combinations) is just enough to represent a pair
  of decimal digits (10×10 combinations). </p>

  <p>To convert a number (like a phone number, 346-4140) into
  a pronounceable string, we'll need to divide it into two-digit
  chunks. </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 Project 1, Part 1_files/alphacode-divide.png" scale="0.5">
  <p>We're dividing it up in base 10; the underlying representation in
  base 2 is not relevant to us in this program.  To get the last two
  (low order) digits in base 10, we can take the remainder when
  divided by 100, using the ‘%’ operator.  To get the rest
  of the digits, we'll use 
  integer division ‘//’, because we want an integer result
  (34641, not 34641.40).</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 Project 1, Part 1_files/alphacode-strip2digits.png">

  <p>Now we want to convert those last two decimal digits, 40, into
  letters.  We have 20 consonants and 5 vowels. Suppose we divide a
  number between 0 and 99 by 5.  The quotient will be a number
  in the range 0..19, and the remainder will be in the range 0..4: 
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 Project 1, Part 1_files/alphacode-base-5.png">
  <p>Just right for picking one of 20 consonants and one of 5
  vowels!</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 Project 1, Part 1_files/alphacode-letters.png">
  <p>If I do this again for the next two digits (41), and the next
  (46), and then the highest digit (3, treated as 03), the phone
  number can be converted to the word “bomelela”. It has a
  nice ring to it.</p>

</div>
<div class="item">
  <h1>Requirements</h1>
  <p>You will create a Python program to automate the process
  described above.  To keep it simple, start by converting 
  only 4-digit numbers, like credit card PINs. The input to
  your program is a 4-digit decimal number on the command line, and
  the output should be formatted <em>exactly</em> as shown in these
  examples:</p>
  <code>
  $ python3 alphacode.py 4327
  Encoding of 4327 is lohi
  $ python3 alphacode.py 1298
  Encoding of 1298 is dizo
  </code>

  <p>After your program works correctly for four digit numbers,
  make it work for positive integers of any length.  Don't do it by
  making your program long and repetitious.  Use a loop instead.
  Each time through the loop, in addition to converting the last 
  two digits of the PIN code to letters, chop those digits off
  the PIN code using integer division.  If you keep chopping off
  digits, eventually what is left is zero, so your loop could
  be controlled by</p>
  <code>
  while pin &gt; 0:
      # your code in the loop
  </code>
  <p>If you have trouble designing the loop, use Piazza to ask
  questions or see us in lab or office hours.

  <h1>Getting started</h1>
  <p>This <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/alphacode.py">starter code</a> 
    may be helpful.  You will also need the <tt>test_harness.py</tt>
  library module from the <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/test_harness.py">here</a>.
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="item">
  <h1>Challenge yourself</h1>
  <p>If you are learning Python for the first time, I think learning
  to express this algorithm in Python and make your program work
  correctly will be enough of a challenge to get started.  
  But if you've just finished CIS 122, or have other experience
  programming in Python, perhaps this assignment is not challenging
  enough.  Here is something you can do to make it a little more 
  interesting: 
  These alphabetic codes don't really help unless we also have a
    way to convert a word back into a number.  Make your program
    convert either way:  If the input is an integer, convert it to a
    word.  If the input is a word of the correct form (consonants
    alternating with vowels), convert it back to an integer.  If the
    input cannot be encoded or decoded (e.g., abba123 cannot be
    translated either direction), print a useful error message.
  </p>
  <p>There are no points for this extra work.  Do it only if it makes
  the project more interesting and challenging.  If you do part or all
  of the extra work, the header comment of your file should include a
  note describing what you implemented, and how. </p>

<div class="item">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>35 points possible</p>
  <ul>
    <li>15: Program runs and consistently produces correct
    output for positive integers of any length. 10 points if it works
    only for four-digit integers. 5 points if it produces some
    consistent alphabetic code (unique for each integer input) but
    doesn't match the specified output.
    </li>

    <li>10: Follows <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/handouts/styleguide.php">CIS 210 coding guidelines</a>, including author
    identification and header .</li>
    <li>10: Clarity.  The program should not only be consistent with
    the requirements and approach described here, but it should be
    very easy to read the program and verify its consistency with the
    spec. </li>
   </ul>
